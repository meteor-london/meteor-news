      section
        h3 "So what we’re planning to do is to build templating on top of <strong>React</strong>"
        h3 "...the best of both worlds: Blaze-style reactive templating, combined with the component model of React"

      section
        h3 "we’re just as excited about Angular. Our intention is to support both of them equally as first class citizens, and deliver the best possible full-stack experience for each of them."
        h4 Geoff Schmidt

      section
        h3 "Today’s Blaze will continue to work but MDG’s development efforts will be focused on the new React-based templating option, React JSX, and on Angular."

        h2 A new challenger appears
      
      section
        h3 "So instead of keeping the old API and treating React as a low-level implementation detail, we want to embrace its strength (the component model and related JavaScript API) and providing on top of it what people like about Blaze (templating / reactivity)."

      section
        h3 don't change the existing API if possible. Not right now. The API isn't perfect, but that doesn't matter. Use the existing API as a baseline; swap out the underlying functionality; and make sure it's feature compatible. It's a classic refactor.
